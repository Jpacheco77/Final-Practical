STAGE FOUR:
Briefly justify the decision you made.
>> Chose to use --bam as the input command because I wasnt sure about the type of data in the genome file.

STAGE FIVE:
Have a look at the metrics - were you able to recover any more complete genes?
Did improving the assembly with Pilo make a difference?
>> Overall it didn't seem to improve that much, with a 0.1 increase in completeness
>> The missing and fragmented sequences dropped by 0.1%.
